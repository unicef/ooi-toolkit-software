The _"Software Development Mentorship"_ aims to review the overall approach to product development,
improving the quality, security of the products and velocity of the teams. The mentor will work with
the teams in several areas: continuous integration (CI), automatic deployments (CD), quality
assurance (automatic testing via unit/integration/e2e tests), reproducible artifacts, development
environment among others.

The [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) defines a standard with 9 indicators to
conform and be considered a digital public good . Weâ€™ll focus our attention on the technical aspects
of indicator number **"Platform Independence"** (Indicator 4).

We have 2 clear goals:

 1. Comply with DPG _Platform Independence_ criteria
 2. Improve the Software Development practices in the team
